# Unity

## History of Unity

Unity is a cross-platform game engine, first developed for OS X in 2005. In 2007 it was extended to  support building to 27 different platforms. The platforms include: iOS, Android, Tizen, Windows, Universal Windows Platform, Mac, Linux, WebGL, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, 3DS, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, Steam VR, Playstation VR, Gear VR, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, Android TV, Samsung Smart TV, tvOS, Nintendo Switch, Fire OS, Facebook Gameroom, Apple ARKit, Google ARCore, and Vuforia. *(wiki - unity)

Unity supports both 2D and 3D graphics, and is scripted using C#. (JavaScript scripting started its depreciation process in August 2017 with the release of Unity 2017.1 * wiki)


## The Whys

I chose unity because I am interested in 3D models and interactive representations. It was inititially designed with the goal of making game development universally accessible, and by 2012 was used by over 1.3 million independent developers to create multi-platform games.

"The world's a better place when people know how to create, not just consume, and that's what we're trying to promote." - CEO of Untiy Technologies, John Riccitiello


## Problem it solves/how

Unity brings game development to anyone with a computer. It provides the developer with rendering, scripting, asset tracking and physics through the use of the PhysX engine, in order to reduce the amount of time and money involved in entering into the world of  game development.
The Unity engine provides a text editer via the Integrated Development Environment to write code. It also provides high quality audio and video capabilities.
Debugging is easy through runtime, as the engine displays all game variables during gameplay.


## Why does one use it

Unity provides a free beginner friendly platform to dive head first into game development. It supports cross-platform development for almost every platform and makes it easy to publish your finished games.
Getting started with scripting in Unity is also easy and beginner friendly, as it supports both C# and a Javascript like language, UnityScript (for now).

An Asset Store provides an arsenal of 2D and 3D models out of the box, making it easy to jump into building your game without the hassle of learning Maya, or the need for artistic design if that's not your strength. The asset store also provides artists a way to sell their work and fund future projects.

Online tutorials make it easy to get started learning unity, and many of them offer the ability to create full games from scratch, with little to no previous experience with coding or development. 


Alternatives include:
- Blender
- Unreal Engine
- GameMaker
- Construct
among others


## Opinion?

- TBD (upon actual programming)


## Biggest conceptual hurdles

(Plan for a 4-5 hour install)
- TBD (upon actual programming)

## 3 interview questions one migth be asked?

#### Why is UnityScript being depreciated?
- A Scripting Runtime upgrade brings the ability to use .NET 4.6 and C# 6.
- Native Array type, which allows you to create and work with large arrays that have their storage controlled by native code, giving you more control over allocation behavior and garbage collection.
- More control over script compilation allows you to customize how your scripts are combined into assemblies.
- C# provides tooling support, like refactoring and intellisense in VS code.
- Unity Script does not support default values for method parameters, nor upcoming features that C# will be providing.

#### What might be some drawbacks to Unity compared to other engines?
- While this engine does provide high quality video/visual capabilities, it falls short of other engines like Unreal Engine or CryEngine 3.
- Built in support for the PhysX engine has some performance issues and lacks some important functionality.(* According to forums. I have yet to test this and see the difference.)
- A liscence is required for better features, including top graphics, and deployment and performance improvements.
- The source code is not available, which makes finding and fixing certain performance issues difficult. 
- Games developed with Unity engine consume more memory than games developed with other engines.

#### What are Prefabs?
- Prefabs are prefabricated object templates, a Class combining objects and scripts. When designing, you can drag and drop a prefab from the project window, into the scene window and introduced into the scene's hierarchy of objects.
-Script can also be used at runtime to add a new object instance.


______________________

# Getting started in Unity:

The interface is pretty user friendly, with the main window being made up of tabbed windows and toolbars that can be rearranged, grouped, added and removed making it customizable from developer to developer, and project to project. 

A project window provides access to your library of assets available for your current project.
A scene view allows you to see and interact with the scene as you edit it.
A hierarchy window is attached to the scene view, displaying the hierarchical representation of every object in the scene, and how the objects relate to each other. 
An inspector window allows you to view and edit every property of the currently selected object, which will vary depending on type of object selected and its properties.
A toolbar is provided to allow easy manipulation of the scene view and all objects in it, as well as access to the Unity Cloud service.

Assets are a representation of any item that can be used in your game, including 3D models, audio files, images, and textures, as well as types that can be created from within Unity.
